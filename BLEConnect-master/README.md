Android app for downloading heart rate data from the Polar H7 chest belt. 

This is a GPL-licensed attempt to make a heart rate logger app for Android, 
based on the Bluetooth Smart (or Bluetooth Low Energy) radio protocol. One
of the heart-rate devices supported is Polar H7, but it may work with others.

I have only tested this code with Samsung S4 with the 4.3 firmware. If you
test on others, please let me know.
